## About ##
_Simon_ is an electronic game of memory skill invented by Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison, working for toy design firm Marvin Glass and Associates, with software programming by Lenny Cope.
The device creates a series of tones and lights and requires a user to repeat the sequence. If the user succeeds, the series becomes progressively longer and more complex.

Similar to that in our game user is provided a **color** in each level as he progresses and he has to keep in mind the sequence in which colors are coming in each level and he has to click on the pattern of colors from beginning till the latest level color in the specific order if he gets any color wrong the game ends

## Example ##
1. **color-provided:**  _blue_ **user need to click:**  _blue_
2. **color-provided:** _red_ **user needs to click:**  _1st blue then red_
3. **color-provided:** _yellow_ **user needs to click:**  _blue then red and then yellow_
4. **color-provided:**  _blue_ **user needs to click:**  _blue yellow red blue_
and so on....
