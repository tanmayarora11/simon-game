## About ##
_Simon_ is an electronic game of memory skill invented by Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison, working for toy design firm Marvin Glass and Associates, with software programming by Lenny Cope.
The device creates a series of tones and lights and requires a user to repeat the sequence. If the user succeeds, the series becomes progressively longer and more complex.

Similar to that in our game user is provided a **color** in each level as he progresses and he has to keep in mind the sequence in which colors are coming in each level and he has to click on the pattern of colors from beginning till the latest level color in the specific order if he gets any color wrong the game ends

## Example ##
Level 1 - blue user clicks blue\
Level 2 - red user needs to click 1st blue then red\
Level 3 - yellow user needs to click - blue then red and then yellow\
Level 4 - blue user needs to click - blue yellow red blue\
and so on....
